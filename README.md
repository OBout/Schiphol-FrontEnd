# Assignment

Please create a page that contains an input field.
When the user enters *at least* three characters into this input field,
you should display all flight information from the `flights.json` file where the destination matches the entered input.
Do this by using vanilla Javascript.

We think 4 hours should be enough to spend on this assignment.

Please don't spend more than that unless you're having fun and want to show off :)

- Make it look nice. Make sure Webpack also packages your styles. We have provided some internal SCSS files in the `/sass` directory from our internal setup.
You can read about these on [http://takeoff.schiphol.nl/component/style-fundamentals](http://takeoff.schiphol.nl/component/style-fundamentals)
### v applied styles, but making it look nice takes me more time

- Your application should treat the contents of `flights.json` as the output of an API endpoint.
It should load this via xhr and should not require a page load when the user changes their input.
